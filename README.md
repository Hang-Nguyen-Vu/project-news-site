# HealthyGlobe - a global health news site
A responsive one-page website for global health news using HTML and CSS. 

## The problem
- Responsive design with the following views: Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column - Flexbox and Grid
- Different headers displayed for mobile and ipad screens as well as desktops - Flexbox
- Drop-down menu in mobile/ipad screens which can be toggled when one check an invisible check-box - Flexbox and CSS animation
- Big news article - text in different positions relative to the image depending on screensize
- Potential improvements: Some effect when one hover over an article, more CSS animations and box shadows in the drop-down menu
